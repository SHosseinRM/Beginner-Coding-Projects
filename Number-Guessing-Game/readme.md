# Number Guessing Game

## Description
This is a simple Python game where the player guesses a random number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The player starts with a score of 100, and 10 points are deducted for every incorrect guess. The game ends when the player guesses correctly, chooses to quit, or the score reaches zero.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 100 when prompted.
3. Follow the hints (`Too high!` or `Too low!`) to adjust your guesses.
4. You can quit anytime by typing `q`.
5. If you guess the number correctly, you can choose to play again or exit.
